# ðŸ”¥ Project Offlineboxels

A free, offline version of Sandboxels

I still recommend buying Sandboxels on Steam. It's cheap, has more features, and supports the original developer:

Sandboxels is also offline! This is just so you can have the HTML file on your PC.

## Known bugs:
- Sand isn't auto-selected on startup

## Credits:
- Sandboxels is created and owned by r74n (https://r74n.com)
